Here we analysed the lipid profile of               lag1               Δ               lac1               Δ mutants lacking acyl‐CoA‐dependent ceramide synthesis, which require the reverse ceramidase activity of overexpressed Ydc1p for sphingolipid biosynthesis and viability. These cells, termed 2Δ.YDC1, make sphingolipids containing exclusively dihydrosphingosine and an abnormally wide spectrum of fatty acids with between 18 and 26 carbon atoms. Like wild‐type cells, 2Δ.YDC1 cells stop growing when exposed to Aureobasidin A (AbA), an inhibitor of the inositolphosphorylceramide synthase               AUR1               , yet their ceramide levels remain very low. This finding argues against a current hypothesis saying that yeast cells do not require inositolphosphorylceramides and die in the presence of AbA only because ceramides build up to toxic concentrations. Moreover, W303               lag1               Δ               lac1               Δ               ypc1               Δ               ydc1               Δ cells, reported to be AbA resistant, stop growing on AbA after a certain number of cell divisions, most likely because AbA blocks the biosynthesis of anomalous inositolphosphorylsphingosides. Thus, data argue that inositolphosphorylceramides of yeast, the equivalent of mammalian sphingomyelins, are essential for growth. Data also clearly confirm that wild‐type strains, when exposed to AbA, immediately stop growing because of ceramide intoxication, long before inositolphosphorylceramide levels become subcritical.},

The bulk of VLCFAs and DHS are used for ceramide synthesis by the Lag1p (longevity-assurance gene 1)/Lac1p (longevity-assurance gene cognate 1)/Lip1p (Lag1p/Lac1p interacting protein) ceramide synthase. LAG1 and LAC1 are redundant but LIP1 is essential. Here we show that 4Delta (lag1Deltalac1Deltaypc1Deltaydc1Delta) cells devoid of all known endogenous ceramide synthesis pathways are unviable but can be rescued by the expression of Lass5, a mouse LAG1 homologue. Ceramide synthase activity of 4Delta.Lass5 cells only utilizes C16 and C18 fatty acids and does not require the help of Lip1p, an essential cofactor of Lag1p/Lac1p. HPLC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that in IPCs (inositolphosphorylceramides) of 4Delta.Lass5, the very long chain fatty acids (C26 and C24) account for {$<$}1\% instead of the normal {$>$}97\%. Notwithstanding, IPCs incorporated into glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of 4Delta.Lass5 show normal mobility on TLC and the ceramide- and raft-dependent traffic of Gas1p (glycophospholipid-anchored surface protein) from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi remains almost normal. Moreover, the biosynthesis of C24:0 fatty acids remains essential. Thus, C(24:0) and dihydrosphingosine are both necessary for survival of yeast cells even if they utilize C16 and C18 fatty acids for sphingolipid biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Gangliosides play vital biological regulatory roles and are associated with neurological system diseases, malignancies, and immune deficiencies. They have received extensive attention in developing targeted drugs and diagnostic markers. However, it is difficult to obtain enough structurally defined gangliosides and analogs especially at an industrial-relevant scale, which prevent exploring structure-activity relationships and identifying drug ingredients. Here, we report a highly modular chemoenzymatic cascade assembly (MOCECA) strategy for customized and large-scale synthesis of ganglioside analogs with various glycan and ceramide epitopes. We typically accessed five gangliosides with therapeutic promising and systematically prepared ten GM1 analogs with diverse ceramides. Through further process amplification, we achieved industrial production of ganglioside GM1 in the form of modular assembly at hectogram scale. Using MOCECA-synthesized GM1 analogs, we found unique ceramide modifications on GM1 could enhance the ability to promote neurite outgrowth. By comparing the structures with synthetic analogs, we further resolved the problem of contradicting descriptions for GM1 components in different pharmaceutical documents by reinterpreting the exact two-component structures of commercialized GM1 drugs. Because of its applicability and stability, the MOCECA strategy can be extended to prepare other glycosphingolipid structures, which may pave the way for developing new glycolipid drugs.},

Deciphering the biological relevance of this network is challenging as numerous intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism are short-lived molecules with often opposing biological activities. Here, we introduce clickable, azobenzene-containing sphingosines, termed caSphs, as light-sensitive substrates for sphingolipid biosynthesis. Photo-isomerization of the azobenzene moiety enables reversible switching between a straight trans- and curved cis-form of the lipid's hydrocarbon tail. Combining in vitro enzyme assays with metabolic labeling studies, we demonstrate that trans-to-cis isomerization of caSphs profoundly stimulates their metabolic conversion by ceramide synthases and downstream sphingomyelin synthases. These light-induced changes in sphingolipid production rates are acute, reversible, and can be implemented with great efficiency in living cells. Our findings establish caSphs as versatile tools with unprecedented opportunities to manipulate sphingolipid biosynthesis and function with the spatiotemporal precision of light.},

However,               Caenorhabditis elegans               has developed the ability to survive anoxia for at least 48 hours. Mutations in the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling pathway promote such survival. We describe a pathway involving the HYL-2 ceramide synthase that acts independently of DAF-2. Loss of the ceramide synthase gene               hyl-2               results in increased sensitivity of               C. elegans               to anoxia.

Because of the risks involved with using products of animal origin and the low productivity of plants, the availability of ceramides is currently limited. In this study, we successfully developed a system that produces sphingosine-containing human ceramide-NS in the yeast               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               by eliminating the genes for yeast sphingolipid hydroxylases (encoded by               SUR2               and               SCS7               ) and introducing the gene for a human sphingolipid desaturase (encoded by               DES1               ). The inactivation of the ceramidase gene               YDC1               , overexpression of the inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C gene               ISC1               and endoplasmic reticulum localization of the DES1 gene product resulted in enhanced production of ceramide-NS. The engineered yeast strains can serve as hosts not only for providing a sustainable source of ceramide-NS but also for developing further systems to produce sphingosine-containing sphingolipids.},

  abstract = {The non-conventional yeast Pichia ciferrii is known to secrete the sphingoid long-chain base phytosphingosine in a tetraacetylated form (TAPS). Sphingolipids are important ingredients in cosmetic applications as they play important roles in human skin. Our work aimed to improve TAPS production by genetic engineering of P. ciferrii. In the first step we improved precursor availability by blocking degradation of L-serine, which is condensed with palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase in the first committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Successive deletion of two genes, SHM1 and SHM2, encoding L-serine hydroxymethyltransferases, and of CHA1 encoding L-serine deaminase, resulted in a strain producing 65mg(TAPS)g−1(cdw), which is a threefold increase in comparison with the parental strain. Attempts to increase the metabolic flux into and through the L-serine biosynthesis pathway did not improve TAPS production. However, genetic engineering of the sphingolipid pathway further increased secretion of TAPS. Blocking of sphingoid long-chain base phosphorylation by deletion of the LCB kinase gene PcLCB4 resulted in a further increase in TAPS production by 78\% and significant secretion of the direct precursor of phytosphingosine, sphinganin, in a triacetylated form (TriASa). Overproduction of two serine palmitoyltransferase subunits, Lcb1 and Lcb2, together with a deletion of the gene ORM12 encoding a putative negative regulator of sphingolipid synthesis resulted in a strain producing 178mg(TAPS)g−1(cdw). Additional overproduction of the C4-hydroxylase Syr2 converting sphinganine to phytosphingosine reduced TriASa production and further improved TAPS production. The final recombinant P. ciferrii strain produced up to 199mg(TAPS)g−1(cdw) with a maximal production rate of 8.42mg×OD600nm−1h−1 and a titer of about 2gL−1, and should be applicable for industrial TAPS production.},
